          <h3>Musical Buttons</h3>
          <p>
            As the sole developer of the Musical Buttons project, I was tasked
            with creating a fun and interactive experience where users could
            play music by clicking buttons or pressing keys. The project
            involved implementing audio playback functionality and ensuring a
            seamless user experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            The solution utilized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create responsive
            buttons that trigger audio playback. Keyboard events were also
            implemented for a more immersive experience. The project has
            received positive feedback for its creativity and user-friendly
            design.
